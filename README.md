n order to run our project, first download the source code from the link above. After downloading, open the project and navigate to jaat/views/cool/. Inside this directory there will be two files called plumbum.html and pattern.html. Each of these files represent the visualizations from the two code bases that our group has chosen. The visualizations are based off of a series of JSON files that are generated from our python back-end. These files come bundled with our project. 

In order to run the back-end of our project, your machine must have the following tools:
Git
Pylint
Python
Additionally, you must download the two source code repositories for our project (Pattern: https://github.com/clips/pattern.git and Plumbum: https://github.com/tomerfiliba/plumbum.git)
